Creating a new PaymentProvider for an Umbraco Commerce site is not easy.
I needed to integrate the Windcave payment gateway into my site but there were no examples out there and the docs are not very helpful when one is new to this particular task.

The Umbraco docs are good as far as they go but I found it really didn't make a lot of sense until I had actually done it.

So this is my attempt at explaining how to create a new PaymentProvider for Umbraco Commerce using Windcave as an example.
